# Hoiseon Social Media Marketing Web Application

## Description

My motivation in this project was to refractor the code, improving upon code that was already supplied to me. Through this project, I consolidated multiple reduntant class and id attributes into one tag, reduing the total amount of CSS code from 200 to 131 lines. Additionally, the CSS is now organized based on the order of the index.HTML document. The HTML also used the non-semantic element div for most the document, so I exchanged the div's for semantic elements like section, header, content, aside, and footer. The original base code also had issues with the anchor links in the nav bar, which was also fixed. Increased accesibility in the application was achieved through the use of alt tags in the HTML which gives descriptions of images on the web application. Through this project, I have learned how to consolidate code into a more accesible version that is easier to read as well as how to properly structure class and id attributes.

## Installation

In the beginning of the project, I started by reviewing the code that was provided and making mental notes of reduntant attributes that when consolidated, acheive the same result as having three seperate attributes. Next, I consolidated each section of the CSS stylesheet including the benefit, search image optimization, header, and footer. After the CSS was reduced, I edited the HTML sections to match the new classes and id attributes that were in the CSS. While in the HTML, I then changed the non-semantic element of div into semantic elements as to increase accesibility. Lastly, I ordered the CSS to match the order of the HTML.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
